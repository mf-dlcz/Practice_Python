#Logical Operators (and, or, not)


#Exercise 1
# Define two variables x and y
x = 20  # First number
y = 10  # Second number

# Equality Operator (==)
# Checks if x is equal to y and returns True if they are the same, otherwise False
print(x == y)  # Output: False (x is not equal to y)

# Greater Than Operator (>)
# Checks if x is greater than y and returns True if it is, otherwise False
print(x > y)  # Output: True (20 is greater than 10)

# Less Than or Equal To Operator (<=)
# Checks if x is less than or equal to y and returns True if it is, otherwise False
print(x <= y)  # Output: False (20 is greater than 10, so itâ€™s False)
# Greater Than or Equal To Operator (>=)
# Checks if x is greater than or equal to y and returns True if it is, otherwise False
print(x >= y)  # Output: True (20 is greater than or equal to 10)

# Not Equal To Operator (!=)
# Checks if x is not equal to y and returns True if they are different, otherwise False
print(x != y)  # Output: True (x is not equal to y)
