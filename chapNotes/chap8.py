#           Libraries & Modules:
'''
Libraries and modules offer common tools for working with different types 
of data and a structure that helps to keep code organized and practical to 
maintain.
'''

#           Import Modules:
'''
When you import a module into your script, you can make the variables, functions, 
and classes defined in the module available from within your script.
'''

#           math & datetime module:
'''
Math and datetime modules are part of Python's standard library. The math 
module provides a collection of mathematical functions and constants that you 
can use to process numerical data. The datetime module provide classes for 
creating datetime objects that can help to capture and format dates and find 
the difference between points in time.
'''

#           creating modules:
'''
You can create your own modules designed to work with your specific data. 
That means you can write custom functions, classes, and other objects that 
meet your specific needs. Because modules are Python files, they're 
convenient to share. They help to keep your code modular so that you can
make small fixes to individual components of the code without affecting 
the larger code base.
'''

#           importing packages:
'''
The Python package installer, pip, is included automatically with most Python 
distributions. That means you can use it to install and update third-party 
packages with a single line of code. Many third-party packages include specialized 
tools for working with specific systems or types of data.
