#       Data Structures:
"""
Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of any programming language, 
including Python. They make possible efficient storage, processing, and retrieval 
of data. In this topic, you explored four of Python's built-in data structures. 
Previously, you learned about primitive data structures like integers, floats, and strings.
"""

#       ITERABLES:
"""
An iterable is an object that can be looped through using a for loop. Built-in iterables
for Python include lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries. This is useful for when you 
want to perform the same action, or set of actions, on each item in the collection.
