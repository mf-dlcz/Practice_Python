DATA STRUCTURES & ITERABLES:

#       Data Structures:
"""
Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of any programming language, 
including Python. They make possible efficient storage, processing, and retrieval 
of data.
"""

#       ITERABLES:
"""
An iterable is an object that can be looped through using a for loop. Built-in iterables
for Python include lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries. This is useful for when you 
want to perform the same action, or set of actions, on each item in the collection.
"""

#       CHARACTERISTICS OF LISTS, SETS, DICTIONARIES & TUPLES:

"""             LIST:   [ ]
-   Lists are ordered, mutable collections.
-   Lists are defined by comma-separated values surrounded by square brackets. 
-   You can access individual items in a list with indexing.
-   Lists can hold duplicate values.
"""



"""             SETS:   { }
-   Sets are unordered collections. 
-   Generally, sets are considered mutable because you can add and remove values, 
    but the elements of a set are immutable. That is, the elements cannot be changed, only added or removed. 
-   Sets can be traversed with a loop, but they are not ordered and do not support indexing.
-   Sets cannot hold duplicate values.
"""



"""             DICTIONARIES:   { key:value }
-   Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
-   For Python versions 3.6 and later, dictionaries are ordered.
-   You can access keys and values in a dictionary using built-in methods or square 
    bracket notation.
-   Dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys.
"""




"""             TUPLES:   ( )
-   Tuples are ordered, immutable collections. 
-   Because they are immutable, tuples are frequently used to capture point-in-time data that will not change. 
-   Individual elements of a tuple can be accessed by index.
-   Tuples can hold duplicate values.
