#                           Syntax and Structure in Python:
"""
When you write code in a programming language, proper syntax allows 
your programs to be interpreted and translated into machine code, so 
that your computer can produce the output you want. There are some 
important guidelines to understand as you start exploring language-specific 
instruction. Expand each of the following five categories to learn more.
"""


#                           Whitespace is important:
"""
Whitespace is the space between text. Python has an uncluttered look 
because it uses whitespace to define the end of a line of code, or 
to group blocks of code together.
"""


#                           A grouping symbol always has a partner:
"""
There are a few symbols that signify a special type or special group of 
data. These come in opening and closing pairs. Leaving out one member 
of the pair will cause an error and your code will not run.
"""


#                          Comments help everybody:
"""
You can use special notation to write notes and explanations into your code. 
Remember, programming happens on teams. It's important that the code you write 
can be understood, adjusted, or used by someone else. That someone could even 
be future you.
"""


#                          Python is case-sensitive:
"""
This means that capital A is not the same as lowercase a. Any difference in 
case from word to word is enough to ensure that they are evaluated as 
two different things.  
"""


#                           Be Aware of keywords:
"""
There is a set of reserved words in Python that are used only in specific 
circumstances. You will learn what they are (and what they do) as you go. 
Don't worry about trying to memorize them now. Understanding that keywords 
exist can be helpful as you're getting started.
"""


#                           Variables:
"""
A variable is a container for storing data values. You use variables 
to store information that Python can reference and use. Instead of using 
a stored value directly, you can use a variable instead. Variables could 
be any number of things, such as a string of text, a list, or an object. 
Using variables makes your code flexible and reusable.
"""


#                           Operators:
"""
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. 
Examples of operators include arithmetic operators, assignment 
operators, and comparison operators.
"""


#                           Python's built-in data types:
"""
Python can store many types of data. For example, a person's name 
is stored as a text value and their age is stored as a numeric value. 
Data types help you prevent mistakes, like attempting to add a string 
"Alice" to a number 35. Examples of data types include text and numeric. 
You can use casting to convert a variableâ€™s data type into another 
data type.
"""


#                           Working with String
#                           Indexing & Slicing:
"""
Strings are organized into entities called elements. In a string, each 
character is an element. Python stores elements in a sequence. You can 
manipulate strings at the element level by using indexing and slicing. 
Indexing is a method to access individual elements in a sequence. To 
reference a specific element, you use its index number in square 
brackets next to the sequence name. This is commonly known as slicing.
"""


#                           Modifying Strings:
"""
Python provides several string methods to perform operations on strings.
            upper() and lower() convert characters to lowercase and uppercase
            strip() removes extraneous space
            replace() replaces a specified string with a substring
You can also modify strings using the following:
Concatenation: Combine two or more strings into a single string
Escape characters: Represent special characters that are illegal in a string
"""


#                           User Input:
"""
The input() function allows you to pause your program and prompt a 
user to enter text. Once Python receives that information, it assigns 
it to a variable. The input() function interprets the information that 
the user enters as a string.
"""


#                           Conditionals:
"""
An important part of programming involves reviewing a set of conditions, 
and determining which action to take based on them. You use these conditions 
most commonly in the context of if statements and loops.

If statements allow you to examine conditions and respond appropriately. 
They consist of one condition and one action.

If you need to test multiple conditions with different actions, you 
can include additional code blocks to an if statement. Use the elif 
keyword (short for "else if") to check additional conditions after the first if statement.

Use the else keyword to address anything that does not match the preceding conditions.
"""


#                           Loop Statements:
"""
Loops are instructions that repeat multiple times as long as a 
condition is met. Python has for loops and while loops.

            For loops iterate over a sequence of items, 
            such as a list or a string, and perform an 
            action on each element in the sequence.

            A while loop is a control flow statement that 
            allows you to execute code repeatedly while 
            a specified condition is true.
