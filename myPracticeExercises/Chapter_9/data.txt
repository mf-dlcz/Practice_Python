Day 160
Purpose is not a single act, it is a way of moving through the world that ensures
everything you touch is infused with a little more love than it was before. It is a way
of being that gives you softer eyes, the ability to see a little more potential, a little
more hope, a little more possibility that the rest. It is not any one thing you do, but
a way you become. A person you choose to be.
