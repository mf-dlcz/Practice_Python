# Use rang() to loop & access the elements of an iterable using an index

'''             Example:
for <counter_variable> in range(len(iterable)):
    print(f"index is {counter_variable}")
    print(f"element at index {counter_variable} is {iterable[counter_variable]}")
'''


# Exercise 1:
#name = "MarÃ­a"
                # 5 letters     
#for i in range(len(name)):
                        # index     access the character at index
#    print(f"element at index {i} is {name[i]}")
'''             Output:
element at index 0 is M
element at index 1 is a
element at index 2 is r
