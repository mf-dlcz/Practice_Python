# A Few Exercises:

# min_y = 15
# y = 20 - 5

# if min_y >= y:
#     print('y is at or above the minimum')
# elif min_y == y:
#     print('y is at the minimum!')
# elif min_y <= y:
#     print('y is at or less than the minimum!')
# else:
#     print('y is unknown')


# Code ran 3 times              3, 5, 7
# for i in range(3, 8, 2):
#     print(i)


# Output is 
# y = (8 + 2 * 2) / 3 * (10 - 6)
# 10 * 2     20/  
# print(y)


# Value of count
# count = 10
# count += 11

# print(count) 21


# What will this print out?
# mystring = "Cloud computing is Fun"
# print(mystring[7:11])       # Output 7 - 10      -> ompu
