# Step 2: Use a loop to print each employee's name and department.
# Example output: "John is in the Sales department."

# for employee in employees:
    # print(f'{employee["name"]} is in the {employee["department"]} department.')


# Step 3: Modify the loop to also print each employee's position.
# Example output: "John is in the Sales department and works as a Manager."

    # print(f'{employee["name"]} is in the {employee["department"]} department and works as a {employee["position"]}.')
    


#   ###############################################             Using Nested Dictionaries:

"""
- Nested Dictionary:  Dictionary that is contained by another dictionary.
- By organizing information in nested dictionaries, you can model your data 
as a hierarchical structure that can include layers of groups and subgroups.

- Use dictionary name and key in bracket notation
"""

# Accessing William's data:
# employee_profile = employees["004"]

#Accessing employee name and age
# print(f'{employee_profile["name"]}, is a {employee_profile["position"]}.')

# Accessing Williams deparment
# print(f'{employee_profile["name"]} is in the {employee_profile["department"]} department.')

"""
- Accessing employee 004's age can be done without storing the value in a variable
- Accessing directly from the main dictionary.
- It's not practical for the goal of accessing a single nested value.


- Start with the name of the outer dictionary. Then, 
use the key associated with the dictionary that you 
want to access, followed by the key associated 
with the nested value.
