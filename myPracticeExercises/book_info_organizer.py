#? Concepts Covered: Tuples, Lists (of Tuples), Looping Through Iterables, Basic User Input

#*              The Challenge:

#* Representing a Book:

Design a way to store information about a single book using a tuple. Each tuple should contain:

title (string)

author (string)

publication_year (integer)

For example: ("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "Douglas Adams", 1979)

#* Create a Book Collection:

Maintain a list that will store multiple book tuples.

Add a few sample book tuples to your list.

#* Add New Book:

Write a function that prompts the user for a book's title, author, and publication year.

Create a new book tuple from this input.

Add the new book tuple to your collection list.

#* Display All Books:

Write a function that iterates through your list of book tuples.

For each book, print its title, author, and publication year in a readable format.

#* Search by Author (Optional):

Write a function that asks the user for an author's name.

It should then display all books by that author from your collection.

#* Hints for your approach:

Remember that tuples are immutable. Once you create a book tuple, you can't change its elements. You'll be adding new tuples to your list, not modifying existing ones.

How do you access individual elements within a tuple? (Think indexing!)

When getting the publication year from the user, what kind of casting will you need to perform?
