#*              The Challenge:

Create a Contact List: Start with an empty list that will store your contacts.

#* Add a Contact:

Ask the user for a contact's name and phone number.

Store this information. How would you store a name and a phone number together for one contact? How would you store multiple contacts?

Add the new contact to your list.

View All Contacts: Allow the user to see a list of all stored contacts, displaying both the name and phone number for each.

#* Find a Contact:

Ask the user for a name to search for.

If found, display the contact's name and phone number.

If not found, tell the user the contact doesn't exist.

#* Menu System: 

Implement a simple text-based menu (e.g., "1. Add Contact", "2. View Contacts", "3. Find Contact", "4. Exit") that allows the user to choose what they want to do.

#* Hints for your approach:

Consider how dictionaries can be used to represent a single contact.

How can you iterate through your list of contacts to display them or search for a specific one?

Think about using a while loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.
