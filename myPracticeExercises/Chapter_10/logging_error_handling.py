#   Logging:

'''
-   Logging refers to the practice of recording events and data about an application's behavior as the application code runs.
-   They are meant to record events and information in a way that can be reviewed later.
-   You can create multiple logging objects to report about different parts of your code.


                            Importance of logging:
Debugging and Troubleshooting:  Logging can help you flag and investigate bugs in your code. Logs provide historical context for 
                                events, so developers can study log files to locate and resolve bugs. They also use tools like 
                                log analyzers to automate the processing of log files.

Monitoring & Performance Analysis:  Logging provides monitoring and performance analysis by capturing data about an application's 
                                    behavior over time. Developers can include logs that measure efficiency of running code. They 
                                    can use those logs to detect weak performance and resolve inefficiencies.
