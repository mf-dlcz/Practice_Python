# Exercise 1:
# Filter cold day temperatures below 60Â°F
weeklyTemperature = [50, 60, 40, 70, 50, 80, 100]





# Exercise 2:
# You have two lists of vehicles
fourWheelVehicles = ["sedan", "truck", "SUV", "van", "coupes", "hatchback"]
twoWheelVehicles = ["motorcycle", "scooter", "moped", "bicycle"]
# a) Combine these into one master list using the + operator



# b) Swap the 6 and 7 vehicle in the list. Hint: Use a new variable to store one of the vehicles.





#c) Check if 'moped' is in your final color list




# Exercise 3:
word_frequency = {
    "the": 42, "and": 29, "to": 20, "of": 19,
    "a": 16, "in": 36, "is": 15, "it": 8,
    "you": 29, "that": 13
}
'''
Find the least popular words! Write a program to iterate 
through this dictionary and print only the words that 
have a frequency of less than 20.
'''






# Exercise 4:
colors = ["orange", "green", "pink"]
quantity = [16, 10, 27]
'''
Create your fruit inventory system - Use a for 
loop to use elements from these two lists to 
create a dictionary with elements from Fruits 
as the keys and elements from Quantity as the values. 
Remember, we can add new elements to a dictionary 
using dictionary[key] = value syntax.
'''








# Exercise 5:
'''
 Write a program to create a dictionary, 
 scores = {} with 3 names (keys) and associated 
 scores (values). Iterate through the dictionary and 
 print the key-value pairs. Get user input for a name 
 and check to see if that name exists in the scores 
 dictionary. If it does, print the score of that user name. 
 If not, print a message that user has not been found.
