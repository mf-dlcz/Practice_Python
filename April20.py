#Exercise 1
#print((20 + 10) - (20 + 10))  # Output: 30 -  30 = 0

#print(20 + 10 - 20 + 10)  #output: 30 - 20 + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20

#print('He told me, "You should learn Python!"')

#Exercise 2
#first_name = "María"
#last_name = "Delacruz"

#print(first_name + " " + last_name)

#Exercise 3
#name = "María"
#age = 29
#city = "Los Angeles"

#print(f'Hi, {name}. You are {age}.')
#print(f'You live in {city}, but you would love to move to New York. Start a new life there and see how it goes.')

#Exercise 4
# Starter code for practicing f-strings
# Modify this code to create a personalized greeting message using f-strings
# Define variables
recipient_name = "Jane"  # Replace with the recipient's name
sender_name = "Amber"  # Replace with your name
special_message = "Congratulations on your achievement!"  # Replace with a special message
# Use f-strings to print a message
# Example: "Hi Jane, this is Amber. Congratulations on your achievement!"
# Your task is to write this f-string in the code below.

print(f'Hi {recipient_name}, this is {sender_name}. {special_message}')
