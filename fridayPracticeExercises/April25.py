# Exercise 1:
# Be a temperature filter! Find those warm days above 18Â°C
temperatures = [15, 20, 12, 24, 18, 21, 16, 19]
# for temp in temperatures:

# Exercise 2:
# You have two lists of colors:
primary_colors = ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']
secondary_colors = ['purple', 'green', 'orange']
# a) Combine these into one master color list using the + operator
combinationOfColors = primary_colors + secondary_colors
#print(combinationOfColors)

# b) Swap the first two colors in the list. Hint: Use a new variable to store one of the colors.
# temp = combinationOfColors[0]
# combinationOfColors[0] = combinationOfColors[1]
# combinationOfColors[1] = temp
# print(combinationOfColors)

        # 2b)
# temp = combinationOfColors[2]
# combinationOfColors[2] = combinationOfColors[3]
# combinationOfColors[3] = temp
# print(combinationOfColors)

#c) Check if 'purple' is in your final color list
if "white" in combinationOfColors:
    print(f"Yes, purple is in {combinationOfColors}")
else:
    print(f"No, purple is not in {combinationOfColors}")


# Exercise 3:

    "a": 16, "in": 36, "is": 15, "it": 8,
    "you": 29, "that": 13

# for key, value in word_frequency.items():

# Exercise 4:

'''
Create your fruit inventory system - Use a for 
loop to use elements from these two lists to 
create a dictionary with elements from Fruits 
as the keys and elements from Quantity as the values. 
Remember, we can add new elements to a dictionary 
using dictionary[key] = value syntax.

# Exercise 5:
'''
Write a program to create a dictionary, 
scores = {} with 3 names (keys) and associated 
scores (values). Iterate through the dictionary and 
print the key-value pairs. Get user input for a name 
and check to see if that name exists in the scores 
dictionary. If it does, print the score of that user name. 
If not, print a message that user has not been found.
